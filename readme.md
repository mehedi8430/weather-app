# Weather App
A simple weather app that allows users to check the weather conditions for a specific location. This app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

# Getting Started
To get started with this weather app, follow the instructions below:

# Prerequisites
You need an API key from OpenWeatherMap to fetch weather data. Replace apiKey in the code with your own API key.

Installation:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
 - git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git


# Usage
- Enter the name of the city or location for which you want to check the weather in the search input box.

- Click the "Search" button.

- The app will fetch weather data for the specified location and display it on the page.

- You will see information such as the city name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon representing the current conditions.

- If the location is not found or there is an issue with the API request, a message will be displayed.

- The weather icons change based on the weather conditions, such as clouds, clear skies, rain, mist, and drizzle.


# Customization
You can customize the weather icons by replacing the image files in the images directory with your own icons.

You can also modify the CSS and HTML structure to change the app's appearance.
